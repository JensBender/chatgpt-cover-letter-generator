<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Utilize AI to write your cover letter. 

How it works:
+ Simply enter the URL of the job posting you want to apply for and  information about yourself. 
+ Using OpenAI API, the ChatGPT cover letter generator will extract the information about the employer, the position, the contact person, the tasks and the requirements from the job posting. 
+ Then, it will match the work experience, skills, and motivation that you provided to the tasks and requirements of the job posting. 
+ Moreover, it will add your salary expectations and possible start date and craft a finished cover letter that you can use to apply for the job.
