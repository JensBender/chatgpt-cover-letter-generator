<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üí° About The Project
This AI-powered tool streamlines the cover letter writing process, transforming job postings into compelling, personalized applications. Simply provide a job posting URL and your personal background information to generate tailored cover letters.

Project Highlights:
- **Web Scraping**: Retrieves the job description text directly from the job posting URL using `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, with automatic language detection using `langdetect`.
- **Intelligent Information Extraction**: Analyzes job descriptions to identify and extract crucial information, including the job requirements, tasks, job title, and employer details using `OpenAI's chat completions API` with `structured outputs`. Leverages `Pydantic` to validate the JSON output.
- **Automated Cover Letter Generation**: Creates three unique cover letter suggestions by matching personal qualifications with job requirements using `chat completions API`.
- **Refinement and Consolidation**: Reviews and refines each cover letter, then consolidates them into a final, optimized cover letter, providing you with ready-to-edit drafts.
- **Multilingual and Personalization Support**: Provides cover letters in both English and German and allows customization for personal background, motivation, salary expectations, and start date.

Streamline your job application process and increase your chances of landing interviews with professionally crafted cover letters that effectively showcase your qualifications.

### üìù Create Cover Letter
Run `cover_letter_generator.ipynb` to automate each stage of creating a personalized cover letter:

1. **Web Scraping**: Extracts job description text directly from the job posting URL using `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Automatically detects the language of the job description using `langdetect`.
2. **Information Extraction**: Uses `OpenAI's chat completions API (beta)` with `structured outputs` to extract the relevant information from the job description in JSON format. Leverages `Pydantic` to validate the JSON format against a defined schema.
    ```
    {
      "employer": "OpenAI",
      "job_title": "Research Scientist",
      "requirements": [
        "Track record of coming up with new ideas or improving 
        upon existing ideas in machine learning",
        "Ability to own and pursue a research agenda",
        "Excitement about OpenAI's approach to research",
        "Nice to have: Interested in and thoughtful about the 
        impacts of AI technology",
        "Nice to have: Past experience in creating high-performance 
        implementations of deep learning algorithms"
      ],
      "tasks": [
        "Develop innovative machine learning techniques",
        "Advance the research agenda of the team",
        "Collaborate with peers across the organization"
      ],
      "contact_person": "unknown",
      "address": "San Francisco, California, United States"
    }
    ```

3. **Cover Letter Generation**: Produces three unique cover letter suggestions by aligning your education, work experience, skills, and motivation to the tasks and requirements outlined in the job description using `chat completions API` and language-specific prompts in both English and German. 
4. **Cover Letter Refinement**: Reviews and refines each cover letter leveraging `chat completions API` with specific refinement prompts. 
5. **Cover Letter Consolidation**: Combines the best parts of each refined cover letter into a single, cohesive cover letter using `chat completions API` with dedicated consolidation prompts. 
6. **Save Cover Letters as Text File**: Exports the consolidated cover letter and the three refined cover letters to a `.txt` file for easy access and final editing.
